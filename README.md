# DemoApiApp Backend Project 

Hey there! Welcome to my backend project built with Java and Spring Boot. Here’s a quick, friendly rundown of all the technologies and approaches I’ve used, from the basics to the more advanced stuff. 

---

## 1. Controller Classes
**Tech:** Spring MVC Controllers  
**What I Did:** Set up REST endpoints to handle all the HTTP requests and responses.  
**Why its needed:** Controllers are the main way users interact with the app, keeping things organized and easy to manage.

## 2. Service Layer
**Tech:** Spring Service Components  
**What I Did:** Put all the business logic in service classes to keep things modular and easy to test.  
**Why its needed:** Makes controllers cleaner and keeps business rules in one place.

## 3. Repository Layer (DAO) & Database Connection
**Tech:** Spring Data JPA, Hibernate  
**What I Did:** Used repositories and DAOs to talk to the database. The app is hooked up to a database, and these classes handle all the data stuff.  
**Why its needed:** Makes database operations super simple and keeps data safe and sound.

## 4. Model Classes & Entity Mapping
**Tech:** Java POJOs, JPA Entity Annotations  
**What I Did:** Created model classes and used JPA annotations like @Entity, @Table, and @Id to link them directly to database tables.  
**Why its needed:** Keeps data organized and makes it easy to save and fetch stuff from the database.

## 5. Dependency Management
**Tech:** Maven  
**What I Did:** Managed all my project dependencies and build stuff with Maven.  
**Why its needed:** Keeps everything up-to-date and makes adding new libraries a breeze.

## 6. Exception Handling
**Tech:** Custom Exception Classes, Global Exception Handler  
**What I Did:** Centralized error handling with @ControllerAdvice and custom exceptions.  
**Why its needed:** Gives users helpful error messages and keeps the app stable.

## 7. Logging
**Tech:** Custom Logging Service, Spring Boot Logging  
**What I Did:** Logged important events and errors for easier monitoring and debugging.  
**Why its needed:** Makes it way easier to figure out what’s going on if something breaks.

## 8. Scheduled Tasks
**Tech:** Spring Scheduler  
**What I Did:** Set up automated jobs to run in the background at scheduled times.  
**Why its needed:** Perfect for things like cleanups, notifications, or syncing data.

## 9. Security & Authentication
**Tech:** Spring Security, Role-Based Authentication, JWT (JSON Web Token), OAuth2 Resource Server  
**What I Did:** First, I secured endpoints with role-based authentication using Spring Security. Later, I leveled up to JWT-based authentication and OAuth2 for even stronger security.  
**Why its needed:** Keeps user data safe, supports stateless authentication, and lets me control who can do what.

## 10. Configuration Management
**Tech:** application.properties, Custom Config Classes  
**What I Did:** Managed settings outside the code for different environments.  
**Why its needed:** Makes it easy to deploy and run the app anywhere (dev, test, prod).

## 11. Actuator & Monitoring
**Tech:** Spring Boot Actuator  
**What I Did:** Added endpoints for health checks and metrics.  
**Why its needed:** Helps keep an eye on the app and make sure it’s running smoothly.

## 12. Unit & Integration Testing
**Tech:** JUnit, Spring Boot Test  
**What I Did:** Wrote automated tests for controllers, services, and repositories.  
**Why its needed:** Makes sure everything works as expected and helps catch bugs early.

## Summary
This project is all about building a scalable, secure, and maintainable backend with Java and Spring Boot. The layered setup, strong security, and solid testing make it ready for real-world use.
